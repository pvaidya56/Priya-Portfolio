									<h2>Why I Became A Software Engineer</h2>
									
									<p>Growing up, I’ve always been interested in technology and how it was possible to make such intricate 
										programs and websites. As high school came to an end, I was left with the decision to decide what I wanted 
										to major in. I ignored all my instincts to study a tech-related field and chose psychology. I sold myself 
										short because I simply thought that I couldn’t become a successful software engineer. When I thought of 
										people who were successful in this field I never really thought of people I, as a woman, could relate to, 
										and it discouraged me from even starting to study software engineering. After a semester of studying 
										psychology, I started to become uninterested and the reason for that is simple. I didn’t have the passion 
										to study psychology. I was truly passionate about software engineering but I shied away from getting into 
										the field because 18 year old me told myself I couldn’t do it.</p>
									<p> I started self studying programming and got into the basics of coding. Within a few tutorials, I realized 
										that this is what I’ve been wanting to do all along. While doing my research, I found out about women like
										Grace Hopper and Betty Holberton who were one of the many pioneers of software engineering. I felt 
										inspired and I soon realized that I should’ve never sold myself short in the first place. I should’ve
										went with what I was passionate about instead of putting myself down. But what’s done is done and now 
										I will never sell myself short when doing something I am passionate about. Now, I take on challenges as 
										they are thrown at me instead of turning the other way and choosing an easier option. Not only do I want 
										to be a successful software engineer because of my love for what I’ve learned so far in programming, but 
										to represent women in technology for other aspiring women so that they don’t feel underrepresented in any
										way. </p>
									<p>When I found out about Lambda School, I was taking CS courses at my local community college and I was 
										planning to attend a coding boot camp. I enjoyed studying Computer Science however, I wasn’t able to 
										apply the information to real-world projects partly because everything was being presented in lecture 
										format. In my opinion, one cannot become a successful software engineer by listening to lectures and 
										taking multiple choice tests. After researching Lambda School, I found that it taught software engineering
										 with the progressive approach that I wanted from college all along. Lambda School provides a more hands 
										 on approach to learning software engineering. It also pushes working as a team and learning how to network
										  with others in order to accomplish tasks which is similar to how software engineers work in the real 
										  world. Ultimately, it would give me the skill set to become a successful software engineer.</p>
